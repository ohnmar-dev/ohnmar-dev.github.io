              Major General Twan Mrat Naing, also spelled Tun Myat Naing
              (Burmese: ထွန်းမြတ်နိုင်), is the commander in chief of the Arakan
              Army, armed organization of Arakan State.[1][2][3] Naing has led
              the Arakan Army since its founding in 2009, and maintains the rank
              of Major General. Naing is of Arakanese descent and resides in
              Laiza, Kachin State, where the Arakan Army's "temporary
              headquarters" are.

            <div class="lh-25 pt-25">
              Naing was born in Sittwe, the state capital of Rakhine State. He
              left for jade mining in Kachin State, recruiting disaffected
              Arakanese Buddhists to his insurgent group.[4] He was one of
              twenty-six men to form the Arakan Army with a support from the
              Kachin Independence Army. In 2018, the clashes between Arakan Army
              and Burmese military intensified in Northern Rakhine State.
